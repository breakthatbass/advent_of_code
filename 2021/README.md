My solutions in Go. *In progress...*


### Compiling
Most programs can be compiled with:
```
go build dayXX.go
```
however, many of the days depend on the `util.go` package:
```
go build dayXX.go util.go
```

### Running
```
./dayXX < inputs/X
```


### benchmarks
~2015 MacBook Pro 2.7 GHz Dual-Core Intel i5

All benchmarks are done with [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine)
