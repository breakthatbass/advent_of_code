My solutions in C.  
Each day can be compiled and run in its own directory.  
Each day has its own `Makefile` with way too many compiler flags.  

I'm still working on this currently. The goal is to get each day solved in under a second...but not to lose sleep over it if I don't.

Simply compile and run with these commands:
```
make
./a.out < input     # each day reads from stdin
```

| Day       | Time (seconds)|
