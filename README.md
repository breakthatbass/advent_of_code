My solutions in C. *In progress...*   

The goal is to get each day running in under a second...
but to not lose sleep over it if i don't.

Any of the days can be run from the root dir:
```
./run.sh dayXX
```
This will compile and run the program for the day supplied, print the
answers for each part, and print the total time, and then
clean up the binary.  


## benchmarks
~2015 MacBook Pro 2.7 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5

| Day       | Time (seconds)|
|-----------|---------------|
|1          |0.003150       |
|2          |0.000297       |
|3          |0.000552       |
|4          |0.010896       |
|5          |0.000721       |
