[1;31m--- Day 1: Report Repair ---
[0mAfter saving Christmas [0mfive years in a row[0m, you've decided to take a vacation
at a nice resort on a tropical island. [0mSurely[0m, Christmas will go on without
you.

[0mThe tropical island has its own currency and is entirely cash-only.
 The gold coins used there have a little picture of a starfish; the locals
just call them [1;33mstars[0m. None of the currency exchanges seem to have heard
of them, but somehow, you'll need to find fifty of these coins by the time
you arrive so you can pay the deposit on your room.

[0mTo save your vacation,
you need to get all [1;33mfifty stars[0m by December 25th.

[0mCollect stars by solving
puzzles.  Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent
calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first.  Each
puzzle grants [1;33mone star[0m. Good luck!

[0mBefore you leave, the Elves in accounting
just need you to fix your [1;32mexpense report[0m (your puzzle input); apparently,
something isn't quite adding up.

[0mSpecifically, they need you to [1;32mfind the
two entries that sum to [0m2020[0m[0m and then multiply those two numbers together.

[0mFor
example, suppose your expense report contained the following:

[0m[0m1721
979
366
299
675
1456
[0m[0m
[0mIn
this list, the two entries that sum to [0m2020[0m are [0m1721[0m and [0m299[0m. Multiplying
them together produces [0m1721 * 299 = 514579[0m, so the correct answer is [0m[1;32m514579[0m[0m.

[0mOf
course, your expense report is much larger. [1;32mFind the two entries that sum
to [0m2020[0m; what do you get if you multiply them together?[0m

[1;31m--- Part Two ---
[0mThe Elves in accounting are thankful for your help; one of them even offers
you a starfish coin they had left over from a past vacation. They offer
you a second one if you can find [1;32mthree[0m numbers in your expense report that
meet the same criteria.

[0mUsing the above example again, the three entries
that sum to [0m2020[0m are [0m979[0m, [0m366[0m, and [0m675[0m. Multiplying them together produces
the answer, [0m[1;32m241861950[0m[0m.

[0mIn your expense report, [1;32mwhat is the product of the
three entries that sum to [0m2020[0m?[0m

[0m
[0mYour puzzle answer was [0m165080960[0m.
